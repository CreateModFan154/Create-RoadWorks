# 🚧 Create: Roadworks

A Create mod inspired by real-world infrastructure, construction, and hi-rail systems.

## ⚠️ Note to Petty Jerks

If you intentionally mess with this project or me — over dumb drama, personal grudges, or to satisfy some weird ego trip — just know: I **don’t forget**.

I won’t break rules.  
I won’t break laws.  
But I *will* make sure your stuff flops just as hard as you tried to make mine.

## 🛠️ About the Mod

**Create: Roadworks** aims to bring real-world construction and logistics to Minecraft using the Create mod’s mechanical style. Inspired by road construction, hi-rail trucks, and infrastructure systems, Roadworks focuses on practical, immersive gameplay—everything from laying roads to deploying rail-ready vehicles.

We already have the foundation started: working blocks, assets, and a vision. Now we need your help to build the rest.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **Hi-rail vehicles** that transition between roads and tracks
- **Road-laying equipment** and tools (pavers, rollers, etc.)
- **Infrastructure blocks** like cones, barriers, signs, pipes, etc.
- **Construction logistics** (drums, mixers, and loading systems)
- **Integration** with Create's kinetic power systems

---

## ✅ Current Progress

- Blocks successfully register and place in-game
- Concept models created (road equipment, containers, etc.)
- Early planning done for key systems (logistics + placement)

## 📦 What We Need Help With

### 🔧 Java Developers (Forge / Create)

If you’ve modded with Forge and understand the basics of Minecraft modding—or you're experienced with Create's internals—we’d love your help. We’re looking to:

- Implement block behavior and tile entities
- Create working roadwork machines
- Add kinetic Create-compatible mechanics

### 🎨 Modelers & Artists

We’ve got concept art and models underway but need more hands. If you’re comfortable with Blockbench and the Create aesthetic, hop in!

### 📈 Consistent Contributors

Even if you’re learning, if you’re reliable and eager to help out, you’re welcome here. We’d rather have a beginner who shows up than an expert who vanishes.
